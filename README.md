# Tools and configs
It gives what it promises: a set of tools, usually in the form of self contained scripts and some config files which may or may not be related to those scripts.

The classic use case is to clone this repository on a fresh OS installation, and make necessary symlinks to the different scripts and/or config files.

enjoy! :)
